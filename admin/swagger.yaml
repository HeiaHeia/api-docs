    This document describes how to use the HeiaHeia admin API.
    
    Authentication
    ==============
    
    For basic resource owner flow one needs to start by making a call to the
    `/oauth/token` resource:
    
    `POST /oauth/token?username=foo@example.com&password=bar&client_id=id&client_secret=secret`
    
    The server responds with a JSON object containing, among other things,
    the access token:
    
    `{"access_token": "secret_token"}`
    
    For any subsequent calls the access token must be passed either as a
    query parameter (`access_token=secret_token`) or as a header
    (`Authorization: Bearer secret_token`).

      Mass operations that perform operations for a set of users.
      Since the mass operations can affect a large number of users
      and take considerable amount of time, they are performed in
      the background and caller should poll the `actions/{id}` API
      to follow the progress of operation. Note that technically it
      is possible for the operation to complete immediately and the
      caller must be prepared for that too.
